    <h1>Benefits of AI in Healthcare</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Cost Reduction</h2>
    <p>Thanks to its ability to spot hidden patterns in large sets of data, AI allows healthcare entities to optimize operations and cut costs. In healthcare, the cost-saving potential of AI may be used everywhere:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In supply management:</strong> by analyzing patient inflow and usage data, AI tools forecast the need for medical supplies to help hospitals maintain optimal stock levels and reduce wastage.</li>
      <li><strong>In preventive care:</strong> detecting diseases early and preventing their further development helps cut costs related to expensive treatment in the future. For example, fitness trackers, paired with AI-based apps, trace patterns in blood pressure and pulse to detect anomalies and suggest visiting a doctor in advance of a health-based emergency. In the same way, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems (CGMs), consisting of an attachable sensor and an AI-powered app, help to regulate insulin intake in a smarter way, helping patients to avoid unnecessary shots.</li>
      <li><strong>In routine optimization:</strong> Modern-era AI assistants (examples include the San Francisco-based product Suki or Singapore built BotMD) can take notes after a doctor’s words, decipher recordings or videos, check-up schedules, organize information into files, and manage appointments. Physicians take, on average, two hours to do work at their desks, but tools like those mentioned above can reduce paper use.</li>
      <li><strong>In resource allocation:</strong> by analyzing patient admissions, hospital capacities, and staff availability, AI helps utilize facilities and medical staff in the most optimal way, and using this data creates results. For example, Steward Healthcare, a large hospital chain in the US, used Microsoft AI to predict how long patients would stay in a hospital and adjusted resources accordingly. This initiative helped them save $48 million USD a year.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Improved Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>In the US, most physicians spend, on average, 15 minutes with their patients per visit, which is not always enough to collect a balanced picture of the patient’s state. Skipping over the collection of the entirety of a patient’s complaints is a real pain point in modern medicine, which can be solved by implementing AI in healthcare. Because they can process medical history 100x faster than a human (e.g., an AI tool from HiLabs), AI tools can assist doctors with findings from years of medical records, thus helping with more accurate data-based decisions. Also, data from a patient’s medical histories can help insurance companies assess possible risks and assign insurance plans and fees accordingly.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Improved Efficiency and Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Medical billing is one of the most burdensome tasks for medical personnel. It is also time-consuming, prone to errors, and expensive, as some companies hire third-party services for claims handling.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI solutions automate the procedures for medical billing. For example, the Japanese insurance company Fukoku Mutual Life Insurance, uses IBM’s Watson to classify medical manipulations and then automatically close payout claims, which allows for more accurate outputs compared to human labor.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Improved Patient Experience</h2>
    <p>AI applications in healthcare have the potential to improve patient experience during different parts of their journey. It can help patients find a free spot in a doctor’s busy schedule, call patients after discharge, follow up with appointment reminders, check up with them during recovery to remind them to take necessary medications and to ensure that the prescribed medications are correctly influencing the patient’s well-being.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An interesting product in this area is Hippocratic AI. Instead of waiting for a medical procedure in an overcrowded hospital ward, a user of Hippocratic AI may expect a call from an AI assistant, like Ana, who will check on their wellbeing, mail them an at-home test, and schedule an appointment after the lab results are ready. Besides avoiding a time-consuming hospital visit, a patient can also select a preferred language, which improves care for the entire healthcare population who work with a doctor or hospital system.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>5. Time-Saving</h2>
    <p>A whopping 46% of adults worldwide consider long waiting times the biggest problem of the healthcare systems in their country. Another 46% say they suffer from the lack of hospital staff. Considering optimizations provided by AI, these long waiting queues may be eliminated considerably. Here’s how AI in healthcare contributes to time savings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Administrative AI applications make smarter schedules (Suki, BotMD)</li>
      <li>AI bots speed up preparations for medical procedures (Hippocratic AI)</li>
      <li>Some AI tools are able to analyze scans detecting whether patients have critical conditions, like brain injuries or lung pathologies (Viz LVO, Mayo Clinic AI tool)</li>
      <li>Decision-making takes less time thanks to AI tools that process the medical history of patients 100 times faster than human doctors (HiLabs AI tool)</li>
      <li>Cutting down routine tasks also increases the time doctors spend with patients. A recent survey shows that the implementation of AI in healthcare expands a doctor’s time with patients by 17%.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is a bird’s-eye view of the benefits of AI in healthcare, but it makes it clear the implantation of AI has huge potential when it comes to moving your healthcare business forward.</p>
